MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The code creates a basic Tic Tac Toe game using Java Swing. Players take turns placing Black and Blue markers on the board, with the game determining the winner or a draw and notifying players of the outcome.	
		Potential Improvements: Also, we could add a reset button and a scoring system. It would be good to include a menu asking if players want to play again. We could also make the game look better, add sound effects, fix any problems that come up, make the code work faster, add multiplayer or AI opponents, and let players change things like colors or symbols.
